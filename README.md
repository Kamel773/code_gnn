# Code GNN

Scripts are meant to be run from the root directory.
Run the script `code_gnn/main.py` to train GIN on code.
There are some other auxiliary scripts as well, such as for training `codebert`.

Run unit tests with `pytest`.

Data is in `data`, pull it with `git lfs pull`.

Trained Word2Vec models are in `word2vec`, pull them with `git lfs pull`.

Expects `old-joern` ([repo](https://github.com/bstee615/old-joern)).
Just clone it in the root directory and compile it.

I have my forks of few projects cloned in the `misc` directory.
They are implicitly listed in the `.gitignore`, sorry if there appears some references to them in the code😊.
